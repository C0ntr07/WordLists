Collection of various wordlists

## NOTE (For Indian Mobile Numbers WordList):-
1. The folder contains a 2-Level Compressed 101MB Archive, splitted into 2.
2. Use 'cat' to join those archive into single archive. Open that archive, you'll get 4 files of 2.3 GB each. The wordlist is splitted into 4 parts: 6-Series, 7-Series, 8-Series, 9-Series.
3. After this *at least 15 GB of space (YES! 15 GB Minimum) per series* is required to extract wordlist. If you wish to *extract all of them, recomended space is 50 GB*.
4. Extract the required series (or all) archive from the 101 MB Archive.
5. After getting the required series archive, extract the *IndianMobileNumbersXSeries.txt from it*.(X = 6,7,8,9)(This will take time extracting 11 GB from 2.3 GB)
6. After getting the required wordlist, use it with any application you desire. (aircrack-ng, hashcat, etc.)
